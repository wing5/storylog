A long time ago there was a website called Suck.com
T. Jay Fowler was a Production Manager there.
T. Jay Fowler created an amazing website, Lowbrow.com

Back in 2002, when Lowbrow was still operational and I
was still in highschool, I would spend hours reading
"the best user submitted content about scraping the 
bottom and being a general piece of shit."
