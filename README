I've always loved true stories. So I made Storylog, a place
where they can live happily ever after.

Back when I was in high school the original LowBrow.com was
still up. It was a collection of "the best user submitted 
content about scraping the bottom and being a general piece 
of shit." 50,000 captivating, self-deprecating mini stories.

Storylog isn't a replacement for LowBrow 1.0 and it doesn't
have the same goal, but it wouldn't be around if LowBrow had
never existed.

I just want to spread around some good, authentic writing.
