Back when I was in high school the original LowBrow.com was
still up. I really loved that site. It was a collection of
"the best user submitted content about scraping the bottom
and being a general piece of shit." There was a lot of really
interesting self-deprecating mini stories, and over 50,000 of
them.

Storylog isn't a replacement for LowBrow 1.0 and it doesn't
have the same goals, but it wouldn't be around if LowBrow had
never existed.

I just want to spread around some good writing. And stuff.

Interesting side note: T. Jay Fowler, the creator of LowBrow,
was once a Production Manager for Suck.com.
