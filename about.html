<p>Storylog is for sharing true stories.</p>

<p>Storylog was dreamt up in a fortuitous bout of hocus pocus in the summer of 09.</p>

<p>It made its way onto the internet November 7th of the same year.</p>

<p>Stories submitted to Storylog are licensed under <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">cc-wiki</a> with attribution required.</p>

<h2 class="question">What was the inspiration for Storylog?</h2>

<p>Lowbrow 1.0 (1998-06), Davesecretary, PostSecret.</p>

<h2 class="question">Why is there no text formatting like italics and bold?<h2>

<p>Italics and bold have their uses, buy telling stories isn't one of them. If you really need to emphasize something, there are *many* other _ways_ to do that!!</p>

<h2 class="question">Why did a story I saved disappear from my favorites?</h2>

<p>It was deleted by its author. Authors have ultimate control of what happens to their stories on Storylog.</p>

<h2 class="question">Why do story titles look stripped down on their author's profile page?</h2>

<p>On profile pages story titles are stripped down to everything but letters and numbers. So _I'm a (story)!_ turns into _Im A Story_. I know this is kind of weird, but it makes Storylog a tiny bit more efficient. This might be corrected in the future.</p>

<h2 class="question">How do I find new stories?</h2>

<p>Just keep clicking the "Reload" button at the top of the page. Also, <a href="/Stories/Newest">this</a>.

<h2 class="question">Something crazy happened! I think there's a bug in your website!</h2>

<p><a style="color:#555;" href="mailto:admin@storylog.com?subject=Something crazy happened!">Please email me to let me know about it right away! Thanks!</a></p>
